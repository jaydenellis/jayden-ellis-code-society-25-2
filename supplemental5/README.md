## Demo: MCP Server Implementation

The `fullstack_demo` project includes a working Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that demonstrates how AI agents can interact with a real application.

### What's Included

The demo shows how to:
- Expose application functionality (todos) through MCP tools
- Implement authentication for AI agents using Clerk
- Support multiple transport types (stdio, SSE, HTTP)
- Deploy an MCP server to production (Vercel)

### Code Location

📂 **MCP Server Route**: [`lib/javascript/fullstack_demo/src/app/[transport]/route.ts`](../lib/javascript/fullstack_demo/src/app/[transport]/route.ts)

This file demonstrates:
- Creating MCP tools with `createMcpHandler`
- Defining tool schemas with Zod validation
- Implementing authentication with `withMcpAuth`
- Handling different transport mechanisms

### Quick Start

```bash
cd lib/javascript/fullstack_demo
npm install
npm run dev

# In another terminal, connect an AI agent
npx -y mcp-remote http://localhost:3000/mcp
```
